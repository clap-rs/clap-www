`clap` generates your help message, and usage strings along with the common `--help` and `--version` switches from the arguments you provide. This means no more out of sync help messages!

Full [help message templating](https://docs.rs/clap/2.11.3/clap/struct.App.html#method.template) is also supported for the best of both worlds, where you want to stay up to date and provide a custom message.
