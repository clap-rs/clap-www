`clap` generates your help message and usage strings for you automatically from the list of valid
arguments you provide, this includes the common `--help` and `--version` switches. This means no
more out of sync help messages!

Full [help message templating](https://docs.rs/clap/2.11.3/clap/struct.App.html#method.template) is
also supported for the best of both worlds, where you want to stay up to date and provide a custom
message.
